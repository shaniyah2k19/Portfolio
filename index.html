<div id="about">
<p>I was born and raised in Selma, Alabama, which is famous for its voting rights movements. I graduated from George Corley Wallace State Community College Selma in May 2021 with an Associate in Applied Science in Computer Science. At the University of Alabama in Birmingham, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. After graduation, I intend to pursue a Master's degree in computer science. My long-term ambitions include working as a web developer, a computer support specialist, and possibly as a professor. Aside from technology, I have other interests such as cooking and trying out new skills.</p>
